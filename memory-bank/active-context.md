## Current Session Notes

- [3:08:27 PM] [Unknown User] Successfully resolved all client and element deletion issues: Both client removal and display element removal now work correctly with proper Tauri dialog confirmations. Fixed command name mismatch, replaced browser confirm() dialogs with Tauri's native dialog plugin, and enhanced event handling. User confirmed both functionalities are working as expected.
- [3:05:43 PM] [Unknown User] Fixed display element removal confirmation dialog: Applied the same fix used for client removal to display element deletion. Replaced browser confirm() with Tauri dialog plugin, made removeElement() function async, and enhanced event listener with preventDefault() and stopPropagation(). Now both client and element removal use consistent native Tauri dialogs that properly wait for user confirmation before proceeding.
- [2:42:57 PM] [Unknown User] Fixed client removal confirmation dialog using Tauri dialog plugin: Resolved issue where client was being deleted immediately without showing confirmation dialog. Replaced native browser window.confirm() with Tauri's dialog plugin (window.__TAURI__.dialog.ask()) which properly works in the Tauri context. Added proper async/await handling and enhanced the dialog with title and warning kind for better user experience.
- [2:39:43 PM] [Unknown User] Fixed premature client deletion issue: Enhanced client removal functionality to prevent deletion before confirmation dialog appears. Added event.preventDefault() and event.stopPropagation() to the click handler, improved confirmation dialog with explicit window.confirm() and MAC address display, and added comprehensive debug logging to track execution flow and identify any remaining issues.
- [2:22:26 PM] [Unknown User] Fixed client removal command name mismatch: Resolved "Command remove_client not found" error by updating frontend code to call the correct backend command name. Changed invoke('remove_client') to invoke('remove_registered_client') in client-management.js line 211 to match the registered Tauri command in main.rs.
- [2:18:16 PM] [Unknown User] Removed backward compatibility for element field naming: Cleaned up element configuration code by removing backward compatibility logic that supported both old camelCase and new snake_case field names. Changes include: 1) Updated loadConfigIntoForm() to only use snake_case fields (sensor_id, graph_type, images_path, etc.), 2) Simplified preview rendering functions to only check snake_case field names, 3) Removed fallback logic like `config.sensor_id || config.sensorId` throughout the codebase, 4) Standardized on snake_case naming convention that matches backend expectations. Code is now cleaner and more consistent without the dual naming support.
- [2:06:46 PM] [Unknown User] Fixed element configuration field naming and default values: Resolved issue where new element types (graph, conditional-image) had empty or incorrectly named configuration values. Key fixes: 1) Updated getGraphElementConfig() and getConditionalImageElementConfig() to use snake_case field names (sensor_id, graph_type, etc.) matching backend expectations, 2) Added missing required fields like sensor_values array and sensor_value, 3) Improved default values - better colors for graphs (#0066ccff), proper stroke width (2), matching dimensions for conditional images (130x25), 4) Added backward compatibility to handle both old camelCase and new snake_case field names when loading existing configurations, 5) Enhanced preview renderers with better fallback handling and error recovery. Now when users create new elements, they will have proper default configurations instead of empty strings.
