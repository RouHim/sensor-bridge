## Current Session Notes

- [5:27:14 PM] [Unknown User] Fixed position X/Y and font defaults for new text elements: Resolved the issue where position X, position Y, and font family fields were not properly defaulted when creating new text elements. Key fixes: 1) Enhanced addNewElement() to explicitly set position attributes on list elements and call clearElementForm() before selecting, 2) Improved setDefaultTextConfig() to intelligently select Arial font or fallback to first available font from system fonts, 3) Modified updateElementForm() to preserve existing form values (defaults) when no configuration exists, preventing empty values from overriding defaults, 4) Ensured proper order of operations: clear form -> select element -> apply defaults. Now all input fields consistently show appropriate default values for new elements.
- [5:23:14 PM] [Unknown User] Improved UI defaults for element input fields: Enhanced the element management system to provide sensible default values for all input fields across all element types. Key improvements: 1) Updated clearElementForm() to set reasonable defaults instead of empty values, 2) Added dedicated functions for setting defaults for each element type (text, static image, graph, conditional image), 3) Modified position defaults from 0,0 to 10,10 to avoid border overlap, 4) Enhanced element type switching logic to only set defaults when actually changing types, not when loading existing elements, 5) Improved duplication offset from 10px to 20px for better visibility. All fields now have meaningful default values improving user experience.
- [5:11:16 PM] [Unknown User] Documented successful LCD preview window reopening solution: Successfully resolved the LCD preview window reopening issue using backend approach with proper parameter naming. Key insights: 1) Backend Rust commands provide superior window lifecycle management compared to frontend WebviewWindow API, 2) destroy() method is more reliable than close() for programmatic window cleanup, 3) Tauri automatically converts camelCase JavaScript parameters to snake_case Rust parameters, 4) Verification logic and timing delays are critical for robust window management. The solution demonstrates a complete debugging progression from simple fixes to architectural changes, providing a reusable pattern for complex Tauri window management scenarios.
- [5:11:08 PM] [Unknown User] File Update: Updated system-patterns.md
- [5:06:33 PM] [Unknown User] Fixed Tauri command parameter naming issue: Corrected parameter name for show_lcd_live_preview command from mac_address back to macAddress. Discovered that Tauri automatically converts camelCase JavaScript parameters to snake_case Rust parameters. The JavaScript side must use camelCase (macAddress) which gets converted to snake_case (mac_address) in the Rust function signature. This matches the pattern used by other commands like get_lcd_preview_image.
- [5:02:34 PM] [Unknown User] Switched LCD preview to use backend Tauri command: Replaced frontend WebviewWindow API approach with backend show_lcd_live_preview Tauri command. The backend approach has superior window lifecycle management: properly destroys existing windows, waits for cleanup, verifies removal, and includes robust error handling. This should resolve the window reopening issue that persisted with the frontend approach.
- [4:58:17 PM] [Unknown User] Fixed LCD preview window stale reference issue: Implemented robust handling for stale window references in toggleLivePreview function. The issue was that getByLabel() would return a window reference even after the window was closed by the user, but attempting to interact with that window would fail. Added try-catch logic around setFocus() call - if it fails due to stale reference, catch the error and create a new window instead. This ensures the preview can always be reopened after closing.
- [4:55:05 PM] [Unknown User] Fixed LCD preview window reopening issue: Identified and fixed the root cause preventing LCD preview window from reopening after being closed. The issue was a window label mismatch: frontend JavaScript used 'lcd-preview' (hyphen) while backend Rust used 'lcd_preview' (underscore). Updated backend WINDOW_LABEL constant to match frontend, ensuring both systems can properly detect and manage the same window instances.
