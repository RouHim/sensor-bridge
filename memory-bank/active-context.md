## Current Session Notes

- [6:46:32 PM] [Unknown User] Fixed correct webview creation permission: Identified exact error - wrong permission type. Replaced core:window:allow-create with core:webview:allow-create-webview-window in capabilities. This should resolve the WebviewWindow creation issue.
- [6:44:36 PM] [Unknown User] Enhanced window creation fix: Updated capabilities to include lcd-preview window scope, corrected URL format from 'lcd_preview.html' to '/lcd_preview.html', simplified window options, and added detailed error logging. Waiting for dev server restart to test.
- [6:42:12 PM] [Unknown User] Fixed window creation permission issue: Added core:window:allow-create permission to desktop.json capabilities file to enable programmatic window creation. Restarted Tauri dev server to apply changes.
- [6:38:18 PM] [Unknown User] Fixed Tauri WebviewWindow API usage: Corrected toggleLivePreview function to use WebviewWindow.getByLabel() as a static method instead of window.__TAURI__.webviewWindow.getByLabel(). Added proper await for the Promise return value.
- [6:35:30 PM] [Unknown User] Fixed Show Preview button functionality: Successfully implemented toggleLivePreview function using Tauri WebviewWindow API. The button now properly opens lcd_preview.html in a new window with proper error handling and duplicate window prevention.
- [6:34:56 PM] [Unknown User] Identified bug in Show Preview button: Found that toggleLivePreview function in ui-utils.js is only a placeholder with console.log. Need to implement proper window creation using Tauri WebviewWindow API to open lcd_preview.html.
