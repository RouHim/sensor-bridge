## Server API Implementation Strategy
- **Date:** 2025-06-30 8:31:42 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** The sensor-display client was continuously re-registering because it was calling /api/sensor-data?mac_address=MAC but the server only implements /api/sensors. While I fixed the client to use /api/sensors, the proper solution is to implement the documented API on the server side.
- **Decision:** Create a comprehensive server prompt to implement the /api/sensor-data endpoint with proper client-specific filtering, registration tracking, and error handling as specified in the API documentation.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Keep current /api/sensors endpoint and update documentation
  - Implement both endpoints for backwards compatibility
- **Consequences:** 
  - Server will properly implement documented API
  - Clients will get proper client-specific data filtering
  - Better error handling with 404/403 responses
  - More secure architecture with client verification
