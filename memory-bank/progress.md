## Update History

- [2025-07-15 2:06:46 PM] [Unknown User] - Fixed element configuration field naming and default values: Resolved issue where new element types (graph, conditional-image) had empty or incorrectly named configuration values. Key fixes: 1) Updated getGraphElementConfig() and getConditionalImageElementConfig() to use snake_case field names (sensor_id, graph_type, etc.) matching backend expectations, 2) Added missing required fields like sensor_values array and sensor_value, 3) Improved default values - better colors for graphs (#0066ccff), proper stroke width (2), matching dimensions for conditional images (130x25), 4) Added backward compatibility to handle both old camelCase and new snake_case field names when loading existing configurations, 5) Enhanced preview renderers with better fallback handling and error recovery. Now when users create new elements, they will have proper default configurations instead of empty strings.
