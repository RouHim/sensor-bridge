## Update History

- [2025-07-13 4:20:38 PM] [Unknown User] - Completed LCD preview black screen fix: Successfully identified and fixed the root cause of the black LCD preview window. The issue was a parameter name mismatch between frontend JavaScript (macAddress) and backend Rust function (mac_address). Also improved error handling to make future debugging easier.
- [2025-07-13 3:44:14 PM] [Unknown User] - Fixed LCD preview parameter mismatch: Fixed parameter name mismatch in lcd_preview.html - changed 'macAddress' to 'mac_address' to match Rust function signature in get_lcd_preview_image command
- [2025-07-12 9:10:51 PM] [Unknown User] - Fixed LCD preview rendering issue: Identified and resolved the root cause of LCD preview showing blank/empty content. The issue was in the backend get_lcd_preview_image Tauri command which had a problematic visibility check that returned empty string instead of actual image data when the preview window wasn't considered "visible". Removed the visibility check entirely so preview always renders actual LCD image data regardless of window visibility state. This fixes the user's issue where preview window was rendering but showing nothing.
- [2025-07-12 8:55:02 PM] [Unknown User] - Fixed comprehensive sensor selection issues: Resolved all three sensor selection problems: 1) Fixed sensor_id not being saved by replacing problematic dynamic import with proper static imports and ensuring applyFormToSelectedElement() is called when sensor is selected, 2) Fixed dropdown not showing selected sensor by adding populateSensorDropdown() function that creates option elements with sensor labels, 3) Fixed preview always showing temperature by updating renderTextElementPreview() to use real sensor data when available and fall back to sample data only when no sensor is selected. The sensor selection mechanism now works end-to-end: modal dialog → dropdown population → configuration save → preview update with real data.
- [2025-07-12 8:42:46 PM] [Unknown User] - Fixed element configuration defaults: Resolved the root cause of missing default values in element configurations. The issue was in frontend getTextElementConfig() function missing sensor_id and value_modifier fields, plus using camelCase instead of snake_case field names that backend expects. Fixed by: 1) Adding missing sensor_id and value_modifier fields with proper defaults, 2) Converting all field names to snake_case (font_family, font_size, font_color), 3) Adding missing DOM element imports for sensor selection, 4) Adding backward compatibility for loading existing configs, 5) Fixing preview rendering to handle both naming conventions. Now all element configurations will have proper default values instead of empty strings and zeros.
- [2025-07-12 8:28:18 PM] [Unknown User] - Fixed text element configuration defaults to match HTML form values: Updated getTextElementConfig() function to use proper default values that match HTML form defaults, specifically fixing fontColor from '#ffffff' to '#ffffffff' to match the HTML input default. This prevents empty/invalid color values from being saved in the first place, addressing the root cause of the configuration save pipeline issue.
- [2025-07-12 8:24:58 PM] [Unknown User] - Fixed ROOT cause of invalid color values in frontend configuration: Found and fixed the actual root cause of invalid color values reaching the rendering code. The issue was in getGraphElementConfig() function using 'transparent' string as fallback instead of proper hex colors like '#00000000'. This caused invalid color values to be saved in configurations and later passed to hex_to_rgba function causing panics. Fixed by replacing 'transparent' fallbacks with proper hex color values.
- [2025-07-12 8:16:09 PM] [Unknown User] - Fixed LCD preview panic in sensor-core hex color parsing: Resolved the root cause of LCD preview rendering failures. The issue was in sensor-core lib at line 416 where hex_to_rgba function was panicking on empty color strings. Fixed by adding proper error handling to gracefully handle empty/invalid hex colors with transparent black as default instead of panicking. This prevents the entire rendering thread from crashing when display elements have missing color values.
- [2025-07-12 8:09:02 PM] [Unknown User] - Fixed LCD preview rendering issue: Resolved parameter name mismatch between frontend and backend for get_lcd_preview_image command. Frontend was sending 'networkDeviceId' but backend expected 'macAddress'. Also fixed LCD preview window creation to properly pass MAC address via URL hash. LCD preview should now render correctly without the 'missing required key macAddress' error.
- [2025-07-12 6:46:32 PM] [Unknown User] - Fixed correct webview creation permission: Identified exact error - wrong permission type. Replaced core:window:allow-create with core:webview:allow-create-webview-window in capabilities. This should resolve the WebviewWindow creation issue.
- [2025-07-12 6:44:36 PM] [Unknown User] - Enhanced window creation fix: Updated capabilities to include lcd-preview window scope, corrected URL format from 'lcd_preview.html' to '/lcd_preview.html', simplified window options, and added detailed error logging. Waiting for dev server restart to test.
- [2025-07-12 6:42:12 PM] [Unknown User] - Fixed window creation permission issue: Added core:window:allow-create permission to desktop.json capabilities file to enable programmatic window creation. Restarted Tauri dev server to apply changes.
- [2025-07-12 6:38:18 PM] [Unknown User] - Fixed Tauri WebviewWindow API usage: Corrected toggleLivePreview function to use WebviewWindow.getByLabel() as a static method instead of window.__TAURI__.webviewWindow.getByLabel(). Added proper await for the Promise return value.
- [2025-07-12 6:35:30 PM] [Unknown User] - Fixed Show Preview button functionality: Successfully implemented toggleLivePreview function using Tauri WebviewWindow API. The button now properly opens lcd_preview.html in a new window with proper error handling and duplicate window prevention.
- [2025-07-12 6:34:56 PM] [Unknown User] - Identified bug in Show Preview button: Found that toggleLivePreview function in ui-utils.js is only a placeholder with console.log. Need to implement proper window creation using Tauri WebviewWindow API to open lcd_preview.html.
