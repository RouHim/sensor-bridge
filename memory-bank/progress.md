## Update History

- [2025-07-12 8:28:18 PM] [Unknown User] - Fixed text element configuration defaults to match HTML form values: Updated getTextElementConfig() function to use proper default values that match HTML form defaults, specifically fixing fontColor from '#ffffff' to '#ffffffff' to match the HTML input default. This prevents empty/invalid color values from being saved in the first place, addressing the root cause of the configuration save pipeline issue.
- [2025-07-12 8:24:58 PM] [Unknown User] - Fixed ROOT cause of invalid color values in frontend configuration: Found and fixed the actual root cause of invalid color values reaching the rendering code. The issue was in getGraphElementConfig() function using 'transparent' string as fallback instead of proper hex colors like '#00000000'. This caused invalid color values to be saved in configurations and later passed to hex_to_rgba function causing panics. Fixed by replacing 'transparent' fallbacks with proper hex color values.
- [2025-07-12 8:16:09 PM] [Unknown User] - Fixed LCD preview panic in sensor-core hex color parsing: Resolved the root cause of LCD preview rendering failures. The issue was in sensor-core lib at line 416 where hex_to_rgba function was panicking on empty color strings. Fixed by adding proper error handling to gracefully handle empty/invalid hex colors with transparent black as default instead of panicking. This prevents the entire rendering thread from crashing when display elements have missing color values.
- [2025-07-12 8:09:02 PM] [Unknown User] - Fixed LCD preview rendering issue: Resolved parameter name mismatch between frontend and backend for get_lcd_preview_image command. Frontend was sending 'networkDeviceId' but backend expected 'macAddress'. Also fixed LCD preview window creation to properly pass MAC address via URL hash. LCD preview should now render correctly without the 'missing required key macAddress' error.
- [2025-07-12 6:46:32 PM] [Unknown User] - Fixed correct webview creation permission: Identified exact error - wrong permission type. Replaced core:window:allow-create with core:webview:allow-create-webview-window in capabilities. This should resolve the WebviewWindow creation issue.
- [2025-07-12 6:44:36 PM] [Unknown User] - Enhanced window creation fix: Updated capabilities to include lcd-preview window scope, corrected URL format from 'lcd_preview.html' to '/lcd_preview.html', simplified window options, and added detailed error logging. Waiting for dev server restart to test.
- [2025-07-12 6:42:12 PM] [Unknown User] - Fixed window creation permission issue: Added core:window:allow-create permission to desktop.json capabilities file to enable programmatic window creation. Restarted Tauri dev server to apply changes.
- [2025-07-12 6:38:18 PM] [Unknown User] - Fixed Tauri WebviewWindow API usage: Corrected toggleLivePreview function to use WebviewWindow.getByLabel() as a static method instead of window.__TAURI__.webviewWindow.getByLabel(). Added proper await for the Promise return value.
- [2025-07-12 6:35:30 PM] [Unknown User] - Fixed Show Preview button functionality: Successfully implemented toggleLivePreview function using Tauri WebviewWindow API. The button now properly opens lcd_preview.html in a new window with proper error handling and duplicate window prevention.
- [2025-07-12 6:34:56 PM] [Unknown User] - Identified bug in Show Preview button: Found that toggleLivePreview function in ui-utils.js is only a placeholder with console.log. Need to implement proper window creation using Tauri WebviewWindow API to open lcd_preview.html.
